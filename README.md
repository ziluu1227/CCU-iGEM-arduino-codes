main_chamber.ino is a code whitch can controll by a rotary encoder and LCD1602 screen, change mode and push the button to select mode to controll in the experiment.

stepmoter.ino is also controlled by rotary encoder and LCD1602, but only can change speed, steps and direction.

both code will be merged in future.
